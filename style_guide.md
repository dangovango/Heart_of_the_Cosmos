# Game Narrative Style Guide

## Overall Tone
The tone should be a mix of hopeful wonder and impending peril. It should feel adventurous and slightly gritty, but avoid overly dark or grim themes. Maintain a sense of discovery and high stakes.

## Character Dialogue
Dialogue should be distinct for each character, reflecting their unique traits. Keep lines relatively short and impactful. Avoid overly verbose descriptions within dialogue. Use informal but clear language.

## Encounter Descriptions
Describe environments vividly but concisely. Focus on sensory details (sights, sounds, immediate threats). For "good" encounters, emphasize discovery and interaction. For "bad" encounters, highlight the challenge and potential danger without being overly explicit in gore.

## Pacing
Vary the pacing. Some sections can be slower and more descriptive, while challenge encounters should be fast-paced and action-oriented.

## Examples (for Cline to learn from):
* **Good Encounter Snippet:** "The ancient star map shimmered, projecting constellations unknown to modern charts. A sense of profound history settled over the crew as they realized the implications of this find."
* **Bad Encounter Snippet:** "Alarms blared! A grotesque, multi-limbed creature, covered in chitinous plates, scuttled into view from the shadows, its glowing eyes fixed on the power conduit."
