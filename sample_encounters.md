## Sample Good Encounter: The Whispering Nebula
### Act 1 - Scene 2
**Location:** Sector Alpha-7, within the Whispering Nebula.
**Objective:** Investigate unusual energy readings.
**Narrative:** "The *Stardust Drifter* glided into the heart of the Whispering Nebula, a vast cloud of cosmic dust swirling with ethereal light. The airlock hissed open, revealing a breathtaking vista of glowing gas and crystalline structures. Suddenly, a faint, harmonic hum resonated through the ship's hull. On the main viewscreen, an ancient, derelict research station drifted silently amidst the nebulae. Its exterior was covered in a strange, iridescent moss. A sense of profound quietude permeated the scene, broken only by the ship's gentle thrum."
**Player Choice:**
* **Option 1:** "Approach and attempt to hail the station." (Leads to discovery/information)

## Sample Bad Encounter: The Void Hunter
### Act 1 - Scene 4
**Location:** Derelict Asteroid Field, near the *Stardust Drifter*.
**Objective:** Survive the ambush.
**Narrative:** "The ship's proximity sensors screamed to life, painting multiple red contacts on the tactical display. Before anyone could react, the *Stardust Drifter* rocked violently as something massive slammed into the stern. Outside, a hulking, predatory vessel, sleek and black as the void itself, decloaked. Its energy cannons charged with an ominous glow, firing quickly towards the ship's shields. The hull groaned under the strain, and sparks flew from damaged consoles."
**Player Choice:**
* **Option 1:** "Engage evasive maneuvers and counter-attack." (Initiates combat)
* **Option 2:** "Divert all power to shields and prepare to jump." (Attempts escape)
